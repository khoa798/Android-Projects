# Mobile-Apps---CMPS121

ASGN1:
  Create our first app consisting of three buttons. Each button has a new page/activity where we do certain things.
  What the buttons do:
  
    Enter Info - Enter info about photos with text and saves this information onto the device. 
    
    
      Done- Exit out of the current info page and move back to Main Menu
      
      
    View - View our typed in information after entering in our data
    
    
    Exit - Simply exits while keeping our data after the application has closed.
    
    
    
 The main difficulty with this assignment had to deal with keeping our data stored and having it persist across multiple activities(view screens). Not only that, but making it transition seamlessly and working flawlessly when moving between different view screens was also an uphill climb. A very fun and enjoyable first application using Android Studio!
